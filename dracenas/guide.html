<h1>Dracaena Plant Care Guide</h1>

<h2>Environment</h2>
<h3>Light</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Indirect Light:</strong> Dracaenas prefer bright, indirect light but can tolerate lower light conditions. Avoid direct sunlight, which can cause leaf burn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soil</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Well-Draining Soil:</strong> Use a potting mix that drains well, such as a mixture of regular potting soil with added perlite or sand.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Temperature</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ideal Temperatures:</strong> Dracaenas thrive in temperatures between 60-75°F (15-24°C). They are sensitive to cold and should be kept away from drafts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Routine jobs</h2>
<h3>Watering</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Watering Schedule:</strong> Water Dracaenas when the top inch of soil feels dry. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure the soil is well-draining.</li>
    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Dracaenas prefer moderate humidity. If the air is very dry, consider misting the leaves occasionally.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Feeding</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Feed Dracaenas every 4-6 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Potting</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Container Choice:</strong> Choose a pot with drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating at the bottom. Dracaenas do well in relatively small pots.</li>
    <li><strong>Repotting:</strong> Repot every 2-3 years or when the plant outgrows its container. Refresh the soil to provide new nutrients.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Common Pests:</strong> Watch for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, and scale. Treat infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</li>
    <li><strong>Leaf Care:</strong> Remove any yellow or brown leaves to keep the plant healthy. Ensure proper watering to avoid leaf discoloration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Propagation</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Propagation Methods:</strong> Dracaenas can be propagated by stem cuttings. Cut a healthy stem and plant it in moist potting soil. Keep the soil moist until new growth appears.</li>
</ul>
