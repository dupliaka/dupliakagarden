<h1>Lavandula (Lavender) Plant Care Guide</h1>

<h2>Environment</h2>
<h3>Light</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Full Sun:</strong> Lavender plants thrive in full sun. Aim for at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. A sunny spot in your garden or near a south-facing window is ideal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soil</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Well-Draining Soil:</strong> Lavender prefers sandy, well-draining soil with a slightly alkaline pH. Amend heavy or clay soils with sand or gravel to improve drainage.</li>
    <li><strong>Soil Mix:</strong> A mix of 1 part garden soil, 1 part sand or gravel, and 1 part compost works well for Lavender.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Temperature</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Warm Temperatures:</strong> Lavender thrives in temperatures between 60-80°F (15-27°C) during the day. It can tolerate cooler temperatures but should be protected from frost.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Routine jobs</h2>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Watering Schedule:</strong> Water the Lavender deeply but infrequently. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's important to ensure the soil is well-drained.</li>
    <li><strong>Soil Moisture:</strong> During the growing season (spring and summer), water when the top inch of soil feels dry. Reduce watering in the fall and winter as the plant goes dormant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Feeding</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Lavender doesn't require much feeding. Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in the spring if needed. Too much fertilizer can lead to excessive foliage growth and reduced flowering.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pruning</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pruning Schedule:</strong> Prune Lavender plants annually to maintain their shape and encourage new growth. The best time to prune is in the spring, just as new growth begins.</li>
    <li><strong>Pruning Technique:</strong> Remove about one-third of the plant's height, cutting just above a set of leaves. Avoid cutting into the woody stems, as they may not regrow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Common Pests:</strong> Lavender is relatively pest-resistant, but it can occasionally be affected by aphids, spider mites, and whiteflies. Treat infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</li>
    <li><strong>Fungal Diseases:</strong> Ensure good air circulation around the plant to prevent fungal diseases like powdery mildew. Avoid overhead watering and remove any infected foliage promptly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Harvesting</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Harvest Time:</strong> Harvest Lavender flowers when they are fully open but before they start to fade. Cut the stems in the morning after the dew has dried for the best fragrance.</li>
    <li><strong>Drying:</strong> Bundle the harvested stems and hang them upside down in a dark, dry, and well-ventilated area to dry. Once dried, the flowers can be used in sachets, potpourri, or for culinary purposes.</li>
</ul>
