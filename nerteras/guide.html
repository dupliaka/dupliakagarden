<h1>Nertera Granadensis Plant Care Guide</h1>

<h2>Environment</h2>
<h3>Light</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bright, Indirect Light:</strong> Nertera Granadensis thrives in bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch the leaves and berries.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soil</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Well-Draining Soil:</strong> Use a potting mix that drains well, such as a mix designed for cacti or succulents. Adding sand or perlite can improve drainage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Temperature</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cool to Moderate Temperatures:</strong> Nertera Granadensis prefers temperatures between 50-75°F (10-24°C). It does not tolerate frost, so keep it away from cold drafts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Routine jobs</h2>
<h3>Watering</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Consistent Moisture:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch.</li>
    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> This plant prefers higher humidity levels. Mist the plant regularly or place it on a humidity tray to maintain moisture around the plant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Feeding</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Feed the plant with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength every month during the growing season (spring and summer).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Potting</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Container Choice:</strong> Choose a pot with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging. Shallow pots work well for this plant due to its shallow root system.</li>
    <li><strong>Repotting:</strong> Repot as needed, typically every 1-2 years, or when the plant outgrows its container.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshoot</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Common Pests:</strong> Watch for common pests such as aphids, mealybugs, and spider mites. Treat infestations promptly with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</li>
    <li><strong>Leaf and Berry Care:</strong> Remove any dead or damaged leaves and berries to keep the plant healthy and prevent disease.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Special Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Berries:</strong> The bright orange berries are a distinctive feature of Nertera Granadensis. They appear after flowering and can last for several months. Ensure the plant gets enough light and water to support berry production.</li>
</ul>
