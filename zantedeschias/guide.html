<h1>Calla Lily (Zantedeschia aethiopica) Care Guide</h1>

<h2>Environment</h2>
<h3>Light</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bright, Indirect Light:</strong> Calla Lilies thrive in bright, indirect light. They can tolerate some direct sunlight, especially in the morning or late afternoon, but avoid harsh midday sun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soil</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Rich, Well-Draining Soil:</strong> Use a high-quality potting mix rich in organic matter. A mix designed for flowering plants or a blend of peat, compost, and sand works well.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Temperature</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Moderate Temperatures:</strong> Calla Lilies prefer temperatures between 60-75°F (15-24°C). They can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures but should be protected from frost.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Routine jobs</h2>
<h3>Watering</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Consistent Moisture:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water regularly during the growing season (spring and summer) and reduce watering in the dormant period (fall and winter).</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid Overwatering:</strong> Ensure proper drainage to prevent root rot. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Feeding</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Regular Fertilization:</strong> Feed Calla Lilies every 2-3 weeks during the growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer. Reduce feeding during the dormant period.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Potting</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Container Choice:</strong> Choose a pot with drainage holes. Calla Lilies can be grown in containers or in the ground if the soil drains well.</li>
    <li><strong>Repotting:</strong> Repot as needed, usually every 1-2 years, in fresh soil to ensure continued growth and flowering.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Common Pests:</strong> Watch for aphids, spider mites, and whiteflies. Treat infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</li>
    <li><strong>Leaf Care:</strong> Remove any yellowing or damaged leaves to maintain plant health and appearance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Flowering</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bloom Period:</strong> Calla Lilies typically bloom in late spring to early summer. Proper care and fertilization can encourage more blooms.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Bloom Care:</strong> After flowering, reduce watering and allow the plant to enter a dormant period. Resume regular care when new growth appears.</li>
</ul>
