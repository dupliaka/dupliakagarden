<h1>Kari Plant Care Guide</h1>

<h2>Environment</h2>
<h3>Light</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Indirect Sunlight:</strong> Kari plants thrive in bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can cause leaf burn, while too little light can slow growth. A spot near a window with filtered light is ideal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soil</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Well-Draining Soil:</strong> Use a well-draining potting mix. A blend of peat moss, perlite, and regular potting soil works well. Ensuring good drainage is key to preventing waterlogged roots.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Temperature</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal Temperature:</strong> Kari plants thrive in temperatures between 65-80째F (18-27째C). They can tolerate temperatures down to 50째F (10째C) but should be kept away from drafts and sudden temperature changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Routine jobs</h2>
<h3>Watering</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Watering Schedule:</strong> Water the Kari plant moderately. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot.</li>
    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Kari plants prefer moderate to high humidity. If the air is dry, mist the plant occasionally or use a humidifier to maintain adequate humidity levels.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Feeding</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Feed the Kari plant every 4-6 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Reduce feeding during the fall and winter months.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Potting</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Container Choice:</strong> Choose a pot with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging. Kari plants can be grown in small to medium-sized pots as they do not have an extensive root system.</li>
    <li><strong>Repotting:</strong> Repot the plant every 1-2 years or when it outgrows its current pot. Choose a pot that is slightly larger than the current one.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Common Pests:</strong> Watch for pests like aphids, spider mites, and mealybugs. Treat infestations promptly with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</li>
    <li><strong>Leaf Care:</strong> Remove any yellow or damaged leaves to keep the plant healthy and prevent disease. Clean the leaves occasionally to remove dust.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Flowering</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bloom Cycle:</strong> If the Kari plant flowers, provide it with a bit more light and slightly more frequent watering to support the blooming process. After flowering, continue regular care.</li>
</ul>
