<h1>Golden Pothos Plant Care Guide</h1>

<h2>Environment</h2>
<h3>Light</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Indirect Sunlight:</strong> Golden Pothos thrives in bright, indirect light but can tolerate low light conditions. Avoid direct sunlight, which can burn the leaves.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soil</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Well-Draining Soil:</strong> Use a well-draining potting mix. A standard houseplant potting soil works well, or you can add perlite or sand to improve drainage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Temperature</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Moderate Temperatures:</strong> Golden Pothos thrives in temperatures between 65-85째F (18-29째C). Avoid temperatures below 50째F (10째C).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Routine jobs</h2>
<h3>Watering</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Watering Schedule:</strong> Water the plant when the top inch of soil feels dry. Pothos prefers to dry out between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot.</li>
    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Average room humidity is fine, but Pothos will appreciate higher humidity. Mist the plant occasionally if the air is very dry.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Feeding</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Feed monthly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer. Reduce feeding in the fall and winter.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Potting</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Container Choice:</strong> Choose a pot with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging. Pothos can tolerate being root-bound but will benefit from repotting every couple of years.</li>
    <li><strong>Repotting:</strong> Repot when the plant outgrows its container or the soil becomes compacted. Use fresh potting mix when repotting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshoot</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Common Pests:</strong> Watch for common houseplant pests such as spider mites, mealybugs, and aphids. Treat infestations promptly with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</li>
    <li><strong>Leaf Care:</strong> Remove any yellow or damaged leaves to keep the plant healthy and attractive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pruning</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Trimming:</strong> Regularly trim back leggy vines to encourage bushier growth. You can also propagate the cuttings in water to start new plants.</li>
</ul>
