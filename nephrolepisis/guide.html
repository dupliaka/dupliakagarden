<h1>Nephrolepis Plant Care Guide</h1>

<h2>Light</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Indirect Sunlight:</strong> Nephrolepis (Boston Fern) thrives in bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can cause leaf burn, so it’s best to place it in a spot with filtered light.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Watering</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Consistent Moisture:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water the plant thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch.</li>
    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Nephrolepis loves high humidity. Mist the plant regularly, or place it near a humidifier. Alternatively, place the pot on a tray filled with pebbles and water to increase humidity around the plant.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Soil</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Well-Draining Soil:</strong> Use a peat-based potting mix with good drainage. A mixture of peat, perlite, and pine bark is ideal for Nephrolepis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Temperature</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Moderate Temperatures:</strong> Nephrolepis prefers temperatures between 60-75°F (16-24°C). Protect the plant from cold drafts and temperatures below 55°F (13°C).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feeding</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Monthly Fertilization:</strong> Feed the plant with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength once a month during the growing season (spring and summer).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Potting</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Container Choice:</strong> Choose a pot with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging. Nephrolepis can be grown in hanging baskets to allow its fronds to cascade beautifully.</li>
    <li><strong>Repotting:</strong> Repot every 1-2 years or when the plant becomes root-bound. Choose a slightly larger pot and refresh the soil during repotting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pests and Problems</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Common Pests:</strong> Watch for pests such as spider mites, mealybugs, and scale. Treat infestations promptly with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</li>
    <li><strong>Leaf Care:</strong> Trim off any brown or yellow fronds to encourage new growth and maintain the plant’s appearance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Tips</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation around the plant to prevent fungal issues. Avoid placing it in overly crowded or stagnant areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Toxic:</strong> Nephrolepis is non-toxic to pets, making it a great choice for households with animals.</li>
</ul>
