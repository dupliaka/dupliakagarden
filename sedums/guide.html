<h1>Sedum Makinoi Plant Care Guide</h1>

<h2>Environment</h2>
<h3>Light</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bright Light:</strong> Sedum Makinoi thrives in bright light. It can tolerate full sun to partial shade, but it performs best in full sun. If grown indoors, place it near a sunny window.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Soil</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Well-Draining Soil:</strong> Use a well-draining soil mix, such as cactus or succulent soil. Adding sand or perlite can help improve drainage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Temperature</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Temperature Range:</strong> Sedum Makinoi prefers temperatures between 65-75째F (18-24째C) but can tolerate temperatures as low as 50째F (10째C). It should be protected from frost.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Routine jobs</h2>
<h3>Watering</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Watering Schedule:</strong> Water the plant sparingly. Sedum Makinoi is drought-tolerant and prefers the soil to dry out between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot.</li>
    <li><strong>Watering Method:</strong> Water the soil directly and avoid getting the leaves wet to prevent mold and rot.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Feeding</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Fertilize sparingly. Use a balanced, diluted liquid fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer). Avoid fertilizing in the winter.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Potting</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Container Choice:</strong> Choose a pot with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging. Sedum Makinoi can be grown in small pots or as ground cover in larger containers.</li>
    <li><strong>Repotting:</strong> Repot only when necessary, usually when the plant outgrows its container or the soil becomes compacted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Common Pests:</strong> Watch for common pests such as aphids, mealybugs, and spider mites. Treat infestations promptly with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</li>
    <li><strong>Leaf Care:</strong> Remove any dead or damaged leaves to keep the plant healthy and prevent disease.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Propagation</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Propagation Methods:</strong> Sedum Makinoi is easy to propagate. It can be propagated through stem or leaf cuttings. Allow the cuttings to dry and callous over before planting in well-draining soil.</li>
</ul>
