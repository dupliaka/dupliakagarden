<h1>Spathiphyllum Plant Care Guide</h1>

<h2>Environment</h2>
<h3>Light</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Indirect Light:</strong> Spathiphyllum, commonly known as Peace Lilies, prefer low to moderate light. Avoid direct sunlight as it can scorch the leaves.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soil</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Well-Draining Soil:</strong> Use a high-quality, well-draining potting mix. Adding perlite or orchid bark can improve drainage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Temperature</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Moderate Temperatures:</strong> Maintain indoor temperatures between 65-80°F (18-27°C). Protect the plant from drafts, cold temperatures, and sudden temperature changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Routine jobs</h2>
<h3>Watering</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Consistent Moisture:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry. Drooping leaves can be a sign that the plant needs water.</li>
    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Peace Lilies thrive in high humidity. Misting the leaves or placing the pot on a tray of wet pebbles can help maintain the humidity level.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Feeding</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Feed Peace Lilies every 6-8 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half strength.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Potting</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Repotting:</strong> Repot every 1-2 years in the spring. Choose a pot that is 1-2 inches larger in diameter than the current pot. Ensure the new pot has drainage holes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Common Pests:</strong> Watch for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, and aphids. Treat infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</li>
    <li><strong>Leaf Care:</strong> Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth to remove dust and prevent spider mites. Remove any yellow or brown leaves to maintain plant health.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Flowering</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Blooms:</strong> Peace Lilies produce white, hooded flowers that can last for several weeks. Removing spent blooms will encourage new flowers to form.</li>
</ul>
