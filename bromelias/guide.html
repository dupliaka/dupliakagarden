<h1>Bromelia Plant Care Guide</h1>
<h2> Environment setup </h2>
<h3>Light</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Indirect Sunlight:</strong> Bromeliads prefer bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can scorch the
        leaves, while too little light can hinder growth. A spot near a window with filtered light is ideal.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Soil</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Well-Draining Soil:</strong> Use a potting mix designed for Bromeliads or an orchid mix. The soil should
        be light and fast-draining. A mixture of peat, bark, and sand works well.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Temperature</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Warm Temperatures:</strong> Bromeliads thrive in temperatures between 70-90째F (21-32째C) during the day
        and slightly cooler at night. They can tolerate temperatures as low as 50째F (10째C) but should be protected from
        frost.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Routine jobs</h2>
<h3>Watering</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Watering Schedule:</strong> Water the Bromeliad sparingly. Overwatering is a common mistake. The soil
        should be kept moist but not soggy. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Central Cup:</strong> Many Bromeliads have a central cup (tank) formed by their rosette of leaves. Keep
        this cup filled with water, but change it out regularly to prevent stagnation and algae growth.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Bromeliads enjoy high humidity. If the air is dry, consider misting the plant or
        placing it near a humidifier.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Feeding</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Feed Bromeliads monthly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a
        balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength. Apply the fertilizer to the soil or the central cup, but
        not directly on the leaves.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Potting</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Container Choice:</strong> Choose a pot with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging. Bromeliads can be
        grown in small pots as they have a shallow root system.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Repotting:</strong> Repot only when necessary, usually when the plant outgrows its container or the soil
        becomes compacted.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Common Pests:</strong> Watch for common houseplant pests such as aphids, mealybugs, and spider mites.
        Treat infestations promptly with insecticidal soap or neem oil.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Leaf Care:</strong> Remove any dead or damaged leaves to keep the plant healthy and prevent disease.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Flowering</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bloom Cycle:</strong> Bromeliads typically bloom once in their lifetime, producing a colorful flower
        spike. After blooming, the main plant will eventually die, but it will produce offsets (pups) that can be
        separated and grown into new plants.
    </li>
</ul>
